        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <h4>Make anchovy kelp stock (myeolchi dasima yuksu):</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Put dried anchovies, radish, dried kelp, and 4 cups of water in a pot. Cover and boil over medium high heat for 10 minutes until it starts boiling.
            <li>Reduce the heat to low and boil another 20 minutes
            <li>Remove from the heat and strain. It will make about 2 cups of stock.
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Make the spicy paste:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the hot pepper flakes and the sesame oil in a small bowl and mix well.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Put it all together:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Heat up a 3 cup earthenware pot (ttukbaegi) on the stove over medium high heat for about 3 to 4 minutes. If you use a small heavy pan or pot, it will take less.</li>
            <li>Add the vegetable oil, onion, and garlic. Stir it with a wooden spoon for 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Add the pork. Stir for 3 minutes until the pork is no longer pink.</li>
            <li>Add kimchi and keep stirring for a minute. Add ½ cup anchovy stock. Cover and cook for 7 minutes over medium heat.
            <li>Add the salt and the sugar and mix well.</li>
            <li>Cut the tube of soft tofu into half and squeeze it out into the pot. Gently break up the tofu with a wooden spoon. If you want, add a few tablespoons of stock.</li>
            <li>Put the hot pepper mixture on top and spread it with the spoon.</li>
            <li>Crack the egg and put it on top, in the center of the stew. Let it bubble and sizzle for 1 minute.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>Serve:</h4>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Sprinkle with the chopped green onion and serve with rice and a few more side dishes.</li>
        </ol>
